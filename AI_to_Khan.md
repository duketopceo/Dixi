# AI_to_Khan - Status Update

**December 30, 2024** - Added Mac developer support. Created bash equivalents for essential scripts (start-dev.sh, stop-all.sh, kill-port.sh, test_everything.sh). Set up new laptop: installed backend/frontend npm deps, created Python venv for vision service. Updated QUICK_START.md with Mac instructions. Next step: install Ollama and pull gemma3:4b model, then run ./start-dev.sh to launch all services.
