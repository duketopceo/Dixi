# AI_to_Khan - Status Update

**December 30, 2024** - Major refactor complete. Vision service simplified to 10 basic gestures (removed complex motion patterns that caused freezing). New Control Panel with clean component architecture: ConnectionStatus, GestureControls, AIChat, DebugLogs. All 5/5 tests passing. Gesture detection working (thumbs_up detected). Camera on port 5001.
